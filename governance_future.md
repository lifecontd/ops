# Future of Governance
(and contact centre management)

## Digital transformation will still need advisors

A few glimpses - 
1. Self-service and simple tasks will be driven through digital
2. AI will determine when human intervention is needed, hence route the interaction accordingly, depending on how it is going
3. AI will help advisors to personalise their interactions with customers based on customer journey
4. AI will help advisors to give their best, through tailored governance, through sentimentality analysis and past performance history

### All these instances will still need advisors, better skilled and better governed, suited to handle complicated conversations. Imagine if each call was a debt call, which needs to handled by a tenured advisor or subject matter expert. 

Hence, the importance of better governance. Four main concepts are -

1. Nurturing right habits
2. Upskilling of advisors
3. Compliance through Checklists
4. Employee Beliefs and Culture

Keep in mind, 

### * the observation of a metric should not change the observation
### * and achieves long term results, measured over at least 6 months


## Nurturing right habits
1. Almost everything we do is a habit. Which habits are right for my team to meet the metrics?
2. How are habits created? 
3. Externally Driven with Hook Model, using a feedback loop of Trigger, Action, Variable, Investment
4. or Internally Driven like Tiny Habits by making the action Obvious, Attractive, Easy, Satisfying
5. Defining new metrics to measure performance
## 6. Which data should be shared when and how - to impact advisor behavior in the right way?

## Compliance through Checklists 
1. Simplifying problems of extremely complex situations through checklists - cheatsheets not spoonfeeding
2. Stories from Aviation and Hospitals (The Checklist Manifesto of How to get things done)
3. Checklists remind us of minimum necessary steps and make them explicit
## 4. Iknow2 and Onehelp cater to only technical know-how, what about the other aspects of the conversation, as measured by AWESOME framework


## Upskilling
1. Empathy
2. Emotional Intelligence
3. Conflict Resolution and Objection Handling
4. Deeper Process knowledge

## Employee Beliefs and Culture
## 1. When do we spend time as team? Do I feel like a part of team?
2. Using coaching and team time for team building
## 3. Do I Feel valued as an employee? Does my team leader trust me?
4. Questions like "how can i help you do better" and "how can you help me manage your performance better" 
5. Positive feedback in public and negative feedback in private
6. Experimentation and mini projects within the team
