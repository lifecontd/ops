## Three concepts for coaching framework
1. Ownership of Performance
2. Microskills Profiling
3. Team Building

## In depth
1. Ownership of Performance - competence. autonomy. realtime and daily updates on metrics. access to data and recordings with dedicated systems. 
2. Microskills Profiling - empathy. self awareness. Masterlist of conversational microskills from AWESOME framework. specific actionable feedback with useful examples of accomplishments and areas of improvement. clips of decisive moments. 
3. Team Building - feeling valued. trust. recognition. objection handling ninjas within the team. buddy system. questions like "how can i help you do better" and "how can you help me manage your performance better". positive feedback in public and negative feedback in private. experimentation and mini projects within the team. 
4. Coaching Framwork - Sandwich technique of feedback, positive negative and positive. Focus equally on learning from own good calls, others' good calls, mistakes from bad calls. Short clips of decisive moments of calls, rather than full calls, as those moments determine the outcome of the conversation.

Today's Discussion

### Problem 
Ideas are not good enough because of lack of business knowledge. Implementation is not effective due to lack of perspective

### Solution
Doing a mini-project with auditing or quality or data reporting teams to gain some business knowledge and perspective. Working on expanding the coaching framework with people working on it.
Coming in by 12pm or 1pm to work on these mini-projects for a month's timeline to see how it goes.
Are there any pressing areas that you would like me to devote my time to?
