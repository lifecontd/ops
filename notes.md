notes

no expert in implementation, neither are team leaders, can we talk to someone who has tried before, more expertise and lessons from previous attempts
i am not saying that it cannot be done, but it is difficult and need more thought than just start doing these things from next week 




act of measuring doesnot change observation

outsider telling them what to do, involve them itself

keep it simple

money can be used from quarterly quota of outing

fixed bays 

asking questions in team briefing first 
6months timeline for the same team


feedback methods
building trust - the more fanfare to begin the project, the more we talk and gather feedback, trial so no penalty, metrics to measure and track but no penalty, weekly updates
data collection



gts
why did someone else get disturbed, how many times
why was i not available
login hours
main, alternate
how long did i wait for an answer
buddy system
stb
attendance - how many present and not, no names 
recorded
useful, not useful
scs



setup
steps
metrics

using whiteboards
too many interventions at the same time, hence too many variables
phases? and cascading metrics

metrics for advisors
metrics for 
someone above team leaders
reward good behavior instead of just penalising bad behavior
unbiased folks to measure?

easiest way out - hence will not work if everyone has to do too many extra things, hmmm, assume easiest way out

monetary rewards or time rewards

what do they want, what can we do for them
how to recognise winners - rewarding good behavior


what do advisors want - money, time, food, allowed to bring food inside, food from firstsource, recognition
what do team leaders want - uninterrupted time, less work
team leaders will not like being tracked like advisors, so anonymise feedback

put in team briefing, so they donot have to worry about logging in, then just before calls start, take a list from ccpulse and give them choc, different types for once, twice, thrice etc - for first few weeks into schedule, not ready time before shift doesnot count
interruptions - by advisors, colleagues, managers

what to track, what we let the person decide 

consistent





what is my leadership style - giver mode while minimising risks and handling objections for the action-taker
lollipop moments - create, acknowledge, share, pay forward, thank


why did i make my customer wait?
what is my customer struggling with right now?
what i wish i knew this morning. 
how can i ensure this customer doesnot call back
what microskill can i share today
what cultural tidbit can i share today



sky pro pilot

  - create timelines
  - design metrics
  - involving me and anjali and kiran and alwyn so basically three teams
  - create a better presentation for shiraz conversation with sara
  - talk with vandy and amith who are already working on structuring the coaching sessions 
  - talk to team leaders and advisors alike for feedback and dip checks
  - go early. leave by 1300 so reach by 1315 latest. they might give me some aux to work on this for sometime daily. 
  - talk to shahid for rostering and scheduling conflicts around coaching sessions and go to supervisor 
  - keeping track of these notes. here on this device and text file on chatter
  - week one for designing the pilot. week two or three to begin implementation. 
  - four to six weeks of pilot and comparing before and after 
  - ideas he liked most. go to supervisor. structured team briefing specially about advisor sharing and how urgent updates can be cascaded to advisors. 
  - how to manage governance. implementation and tracking. 
  - implementation methods? design thinking? 
  - define problem statements. 
  - exact steps to be followed and tracking methods. 
  - kiran comes early by 1230 so go early for three days in this week. sat wed thu. then anyway will move to night shift so these folks will come late. leave by noon on these three days. 
  - put in loads of effort. this is your best chance. implement this well and let the rest of the floor adopt this as well. 
  - be overoverprepared always. 
  - next steps. shiraz as reference. working directly with sara might be an awesome option. working with gbl and sd with this implementation experience. 
  - create structure for the entire pilot 
  - keep your mouth shut about your background and experience. 
  - creating a list of questions for tomorrow discussion. ask questions. stay humble. open to discussions. ask for opinions. be politics savvy. polite and friendly with everyone. patofy everyone including three team leaders i need to work with and shiraz and other managers i need to work with
  - create a separate page of insights that shiraz can share with sara. which are more high level. 
  - look at insights course notes
  - this long weekend finalise all insights document. 
  - sharing via website was good. as people can read them at their convenience. 
  - opportunity to display expertise and experience and new ideas
  - opportunity to be humble and open to feedback and opinions. showing vulnerability and need for help and need for teamwork 
  - stay calm despite the workload. 
  - aim of this and subsequent pilots is to create and unclog feedback loops. encourage true ownership and responsibility.

  - profiling an advisor for coaching

  - apparently according to shiraz only managers can take escalations. but that is not true in practice. hmm. what about sme or deputy managers. similar to senior advisors who are handling teams like anjali before they become team leaders. probationary. 
  - create genuine metrics keeping in mind the mouse tail. even though they might be unmeasurable at the moment. 
  - be responsible for a series of pilots. demonstrate your absolute utility 
  - i will create a new github login. with skypro. and detail everything out there as well. like my fsl portfolio. hmmm. and easy to share updates with them as well. done with skypro2020

20191228
initial discussion with kiran. 17 points. 
  - work within our team for one week and then share with shiraz. kiran sounds super interested himself 
  - sharing microskills between advisors 
  - behavior issues due to fear of metrics 
  - people using cisco to put customer on hold instead of stan so that it doesnot count against their metric or transferring calls for unhappy customers to avoid survey
  - adhocs. advisors walking up to team leader even if not required as they are not sure of the answers 
  - buddy system. check with a senior advisor before you check with team leader 
  - alternative to go to supervisor. like a senior advisor if escalation 
  - what does a team leader spend time on. restructure their day
  - team leaders do homework before coaching sessions. so 15 to 45m of homework to gain most out of advisor performance session 
  - creating advisor profiles based on microskills they have. and drive coaching accordingly. creating database of specialist advisors can be the next step. or working with corporate trainers for those specific skills. 
  - create a masterlist of conversational microskills 
  - sending metrics on a daily basis or letting advisors access them directly so that they take ownership of their own metrics. what can be improved upon and what went well
  - sandwich technique. how much time should be spent on negative feedback. 
  - consistent pre shift team briefing of fifteen to twenty minutes and leave off on time without any briefing. one thing might be that if you extend due to stuck on call you might take a longer lunch break or on a weekly or monthly basis might be exempt from those many minutes. 
  - taking advisors into confidence. let them create community. creating goodwill. 
  - spending time as a team. 
  - excel sheet to test answers to which questions are most helpful like a facebook post. the most number of likes. a competition of doing better than each other and helping each other. 
  - unresolved calls. empathy and assurance and understanding their point of view. so not leading to dissatisfaction even if not a full resolution is possible. show that you care. 
  - track advisor growth and journey. profiling advisor. 
  - team briefings. how to increase retention and implementation of material. 
  - 



  - internal conversation among the four of us. hmmm
  - mice tails example 
  - go to supervisor - team leaders schedules on a weekly basis
  - assistant point of contact. plus teams sitting together. secondary point of contact. 
  - chatter group for lively community and updates
  - structured team briefing - iknow updates and sharing understanding. sts product features and how to sell. microskill from tl about call i liked. jazz calls. questions. nps comments. 15m fixed in morning and 5m to answer questions in evening. kiran might send that day metrics within last one hour. important updates from tl. use stopwatch. 
  - negative feedback in private. positive feedback with everyone 
  - anjali.  sharma@    gkiran.raju@ eend email by mon or wed. 
  - coaching sessions. before and after implementation of feedback. listen to difference in calls 
  - auditing teams making note of clip timings. 
  - awesome framework to create microskills framework 
  - different people needing different kinds of performance sessions. personal touch
  - sky coach program. break ice. comfortable atmosphere undisturbed. listen to call. both coach and advisor list good points and points of improvement  then coach asks advisors to tell. and asks what stopped you from doing something. how will you implement it and how will measure the implementation. 
  - strong team culture so newcomers get moulded fast. through call structures. tips snd tactics. gatherings. teasing. 
  - unlearning unproductive behavior 
  - self driven check updates from iknow and sts. 
  - fgg
  - 

20200101
